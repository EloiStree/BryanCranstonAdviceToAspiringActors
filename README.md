> Well, the best advice for fellow actors is this: know what your job is about. 18 years ago, I had this realization that I was going into auditions trying to get a job, and that simply wasn't what I was supposed to be doing. An actor is supposed to create a compelling, interesting character that serves the text presented in the audition, and then you walk away. Everything else is out of your control, so don't even think about it. Don't focus on getting a job, focus on presenting your acting abilities. When you do this, there's power and confidence in your performance, and you're acknowledging that the decision of who gets a job is out of your control. Once I adapted this philosophy, I never looked back and I've never been busier in my life.
